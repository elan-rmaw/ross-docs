Most series have no, or very little cleaning, such as the below![[Pasted image 20250130160735.png]]
In which case cleaning is arguably not necessary as no points are being cleaned

Others have sections of data well outside of the bounds

(guessing due to no liquidity?)



In general, very little cleaning one contracts become active

There are cases where trimmed means helps and cleans legitimately bad data (Most likely)

Current method would clean genuine large market moves

Neither work for session open and closes (current method may clean, but rarely, trimmed means has no chance)

Trimmed means will also work when there is a large bid ask spread (current method cannot cope)
